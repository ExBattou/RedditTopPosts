#Reddit Top Posts Viewer

 - Greetings! You are now reading what I wrote for this test app. One of the things that was requested for the current app was to have a Readme file with what I have done for this task. So, yay! I already did something.
 
## Overview
- As stated before, this app was requested to be completed with a couple of features, and below I'll list the ones I have added
	* Infinite list on Reddit Top Posts, Using a RecyclerView being loaded with Paging 3, Room and Flow.
	* Thumbnails for that list, implementing Glide.
	* Pull to Refresh, using SwipeRefreshLayout
	* Offline mode and saving data with Room
